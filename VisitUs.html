                <h1>What is carbon footprint?</h1>
                <p1>
                    It is the amount of carbon dioxide released as a part of the activities of an individual, organisation or community.
                </p1>
                <br />
                <h1>How is it measured?</h1>
                <p2>
                    It is measured in co2e which is the amount of carbon dioxide needed to have the same impact as the carbon emission in question.
                </p2>
                <br />
                <h1>Why should we care about tracking our carbon emissions?</h1>
                <p3>
                    Human activities have caused many disastrous effects on the Earth. One of them is global warming.
                </p3>
                <br />
                <h1>What is global warming?</h1>
                <p4>
                    Global warming is the increasing of the Earth’s atmosphere due to the greenhouse effect caused by emission of gases such as carbon dioxide, CFCs, and other pollutants.

                <h1>Harmful effects of global warming</h1>
                <p1>
                    Global warming can lead to many disastrous side effects on human health and living conditions. The obvious effect is increase of the temperature of the Earth’s atmosphere.
                </p1>
                <br />

                <p2>
                    This causes ice bergs to melt and sea levels to rise leading to the loss of coastal land. Global warming can increase the risk and severity of serious environmental threats such as increased droughts, floods, and endangering biodiversity.
                </p2>

                <h1>Top causes of emissions:</h1>
                <p3>
                    As shown in the diagram above produced by the US Environmental Protection Agency, transportation is the leading cause caron emission making up almost 30 percent.
                </p3>

                <h1>History of carbon emission: </h1>
                <p4>
                    Since the early days, Man has been finding ways to improve technology and lives. However, most of the time, this comes  at a price. Our carbon emission rates have Increased 150 times higher than in 2011 according to an article published by World Resources Institute.

                <h1>History</h1>
                <p1>
                    In 1850, the UK was the highest emitter, nearly 6 times of the second biggest emitter the US. France, Belgium, Germany was also in the top 5 list.

                    <br />

                    <p2>
                        Today, China is the world largest emitter followed by the US, India, Russia, and Japan.
                    </p2>
                    <br />
                    <p3>
                        The cause of this was mostly industrialisation. From 1850 to 1960, advancements in technology and industrialisation  caused the world experienced a constant growth in carbon emission, except for some major events like the Great Depression in the 1930s and Second World War in the 1940s.
                    </p3>
                    <br />
                    <p4>
                        After 1960, the US remained as the top emitter until 2005, whilst other countries such as China started to emerge.	UK reduced its carbon emissions .
                    </p4>
                    <br />
                    <p5>Russia also  experienced a reduction of carbon emission with the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In 2005, China emerged as the largest emitter. From 2005 to 2011 many more countries started to produce carbon emission. By 2011 Indonesia and Brazil had joined the top ten list led by China.</p5>
